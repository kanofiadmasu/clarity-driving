# Clarity Driving School
--- 
This is a landing page I built for a Driving School in Toronto as a freelncer. The Driving school doesn't have a webpage before, reducing thier credibility and online presence. 

## Purpose of the landing page
This landing page apart from providing information it was primarily built making online presence and credibilty as a central goal. This webpage was built for multiple reasons, 
credibilty and online presence being the central one, other important things are also included, such as providing information about the school(their contact and adresss), services they offer,
and also displaying testimony of previous students.
